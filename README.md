My project around 2023 as required by a course entitled "Emerging Technologies 3 in CpE (Mobile Computing)".

Used the Kotlin programming language in Android Studio to develop an application that showcases the following:
* Navigation
* Material Design
* Application Programming Interface (API)
* Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) with ROOM Database
